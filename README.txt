# 🌐 Michael Okanta – Personal Website (v2)

Welcome to the second (and way better) version of my personal website — built with clean HTML, CSS, and lots of learning.

My first portfolio site was… not great. But instead of settling, I dug deeper into front-end structure, layout principles, and visual storytelling. This new version reflects that growth — and tells my story more fully, more clearly, and more intentionally.
